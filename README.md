# Repository Privacy Notice

## Privacy Requirement

All my **26** repositories associated with my GitHub account are set to private due to client privacy requirements. 

## Client Confidentiality

As a professional software developer, I take client confidentiality very seriously. Many of the projects I work on involve sensitive information and proprietary code owned by my clients. 

## Why Repositories Are Private

To ensure the protection of my clients' intellectual property and sensitive information, I have made the decision to keep all repositories private by default. This means that you may not be able to view the code for specific projects in my GitHub profile.

## How to Request Access

If you are a potential employer, collaborator, or interested party who would like to review my code or discuss potential projects, please reach out to me directly. I am more than happy to provide additional information, discuss my past work, or provide access to relevant repositories on a case-by-case basis, subject to client approval.

## Contact Information

If you have any questions or would like to discuss further, please feel free to contact me:

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Sincerely,

Jair Cussy
